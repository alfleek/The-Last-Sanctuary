###Format:

## Check-In #1 : 
- How did you structure your main game loop or update cycle in Unity?

- What tools or methods did you use to design and texture your environment (e.g., terrain tools, tilemaps, layers)?  
<t>I mainly used prefabs and assets from the Unity Asset Store to build the terrain and environment by hand. Using Unityâ€™s Terrain Tools, I shaped the landscape and added different textures like grass, dirt, and rock. I placed props such as trees, rocks, and structures manually to make the world feel more realistic. Lighting and post-processing were added to create a dark, immersive atmosphere that fits the survival theme.

- How did you implement player controls (movement, jumping, camera/view rotation, etc.)?
